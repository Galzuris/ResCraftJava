## About

2D blocky survival game, with craft, mobs and base building.

### Project goals

- Reduce the number of any files. Including classes, configs and images
- Use fewer classes and a simpler architecture to reduce device overhead
- Avoid excessive parallelism and threads

## Note

The code is messy, with singletons and superclasses due to severe performance and memory limitations on mobile devices.
